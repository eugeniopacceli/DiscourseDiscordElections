# DiscourseDiscordElections
An election system for a community-ruled Discord chat server

You may copy, use and modify, given the proper credits.

To run this project, make sure you have a valid Discord OAuth 2 registered application and configure `ddelection.js` to use it.

`runforever.sh` starts the server and guards for crashes.

`ddelection.js` also assumes you have a valid SSL certificate, as it runs only on HTTPs to store user's session values.

This is still a work in progress.
