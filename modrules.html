                <h4 class="card-title">The Code Of Conduct For Moderators Of Discourse Discord</h4>
                <p class="card-text">1. Decorum: Moderators represent the server as leaders of the server. Moderators are EXPECTED to be civil to members within reason. Don't abuse people and don't take abuse from members. Moderators are expected to be civil and to be kind to the members and give them your ears to listen to. Be respectful towards your constituents.</p>
                <p class="card-text">2. Banning: Members should only be banned on sight if they're obvious trolls: i.e. screaming in VC, spamming in general or harrassing other users. Otherwise, banning should be put up for vote after a warning and a time out.</p>
                <p class="card-text">3. Timeout: Timing out members should only happen if a member is obviously being disruptive or harassing other members. It is not OK to mute or time a member out simply because they disagree with you.</p>
                <p class="card-text">4. @ everyone: DO NOT @ EVERYONE unless it is extremely important, like some major breaking news or there's a major announcement i.e.: Partnerships or if like Obama joined into the server or if Trump is being indicted.</p>
                <p class="card-text">5. Input: You've been elected. Be around. Members of the server elected you as they see you as someone who can represent the server and govern it effectively so you should be around and do some moderating.</p>
                <p class="card-text">6. Mod decisions outside of muting shall require a mod vote of 51% or greater in order to pass.</p>
                <p class="card-text">7. Things subject to vote should be tendered for discussion with a pin in #assembly-floor for a period no less than 24 hours before it can be put to a vote in #assembly-voting.</p>
                <p class="card-text">8. Mods shall not use powers given to them by way of being a mod in order to pursue a personal agenda, if a mod feels they may be conflicted in this way they should seek the opinion of a second mod.</p>
                <p class="card-text">9. Mods are not above the rules, they are to follow all server rules.</p>
