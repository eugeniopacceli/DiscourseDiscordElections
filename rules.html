                <h4 class="card-title">The Rules Of Discourse Discord</h4>
                <p class="card-text">1. Keep it civil. Constructive debate is good; name calling is not. Nuanced discussion about social issues is fine; bigoted points of view is not. Hateful comments about someone's personal characteristics are discriminatory and will be moderated; focus on their views instead of what they look and sound like. Don't engage in personal attacks. When in a heated debate, try to recognize and manage your own emotions, and try to understand how your comments impact others emotionally.</p>
                <p class="card-text">2.  Do not advertise or post racist, sexist, homophobic or otherwise discriminatory content. Blatant promotion of discriminatory or hate-based ideologies outside of honest debate is not allowed.</p>
                <p class="card-text">3. Post in the right channel. NSFW content must go in the NSFW room. Legal but disgusting content in the NSFW channel will be moderated. Do not post anything that would be in violation of U.S. law. No pro-pedophila discussion allowed in any channel.</p>
                <p class="card-text">4. Don’t continuously write in all caps or spam text channels. Don’t talk over other people or flood voice channels during discussions.</p>
                <p class="card-text">5. Don’t impersonate other users, or use NSFW names / avatars. Names should use standard characters. Don't share personal information that isn't your own. Don't harass other users; if someone tells you to stop interacting with them, avoid trouble!</p>
                <p class="card-text">6. No advertising or spamming of invites to other discords. Don’t spam invites to this server in other servers, or engage in raiding-like activity.</p>
                <p class="card-text">7. Enforcement of rules subject to moderator discretion.</p>
